    <h1>Difference between var let and const</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate
        function body
      </li>

      <li>Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted</li>
      <li>Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped</li>
      <li>Variables that are declared with var keyword have function scope</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>difference between arrow function and regular function</h1>
    <p>
      Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are
      constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible,
      they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are
      only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used
      as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new
      keyword.

    <h1>map(), foreach(), filter(), find()</h1>
    <p>
      map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a
      new array with the updated elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array
      but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain
      criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for
      the criteria.
